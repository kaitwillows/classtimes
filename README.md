# progress:
this project is very much a work in progress, it is not functional yet

the following is a list of things that need to get done:
- [ ] pre-processing
  - [x] recursively scrape data into a python dictionary tree
    - [ ] include/concatinate multiple files
  - [ ] translate the tree of class sections and when/where they meet, to a data structre in terms of room numbers and when they're booked
- [ ] TODO: postprocessing


# limitations(??)
- since the classroom data is semi-private, i wont be having it packaged with the code
- as the data only needs to be gathered/preprocessed once per semester, its not imperative that the process be automated
